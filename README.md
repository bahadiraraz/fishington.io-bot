# How to Use 
 - Open CMD in `fishington.io-bot` folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - run the bot and switch to the window running fishington (you have 5 seconds until it starts fishing)
 - stop the bot by pressing `q` on the `main` window or by forcing the script to stop

# Hints
- works on most screen sizes
- only works if you stand right underneath the shop so the character can reach the shop by just walking up straight
- **works best in FULLSCREEN**
- **works best if you stand right at the end of the bridge so there's only water underneath your character**
